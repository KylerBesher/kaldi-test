          **Before you come in for a tattoo:**
          * Make sure that you have had a well balanced meal to help prevent  lightheadedness.
          * You are more than welcome to bring something to drink with you,   something with sugar in it is encouraged.
          * Know that music will be playing in the shop, but if you would like  to bring your own music you are welcome to bring a pair of headphones  with you.

          ### Traditional Aftercare For Tattoos
          #### 1. Remove bandage in a CLEAN bathroom after one hour.
          #### 2. After removing bandage, wash the tattoo immediately with warm   water and soap.

          We recommend a plain anti-bacterial soap. Do NOT use a soap with  fragrance, moisture beads, or scrubs.

          #### 3. TO WASH A FRESH TATTOO:
          * Wash your hands well with soap and warm water
          * Carefully remove the bandage from your tattoo
          * Make a lather in your hand with soap and warm water
          * Gently clean tattoo using circular motions until all ointment, and  any fluids are removed
          * Rinse the tattoo until all the soap is washed off
          * Let dry for 5-10 minutes
          #### 4. Once the tattoo is dry apply AQUAPHOR healing ointment, made  by Eucerin.
          Apply a thin layer and rub it in, then dab excess off with a clean  paper towel. Use the Aquaphor 3-5 times a day for the first 3 days   then switch to a regular FRAGRANCE FREE lotion such as Lubriderm, or  any other fragrance free brand and apply 5-7 times a day for 7-10  days.
          #### 5. Fresh tattoos sometimes weep during the first couple of days  causing a thin moist coating on the skin.
          This can be DABBED with a clean paper towel. Press the paper towel to   the skin and remove. Do not wipe the tattoo or be rough with it.  Excess ink may be on the paper towel, this is normal due to ink being  sloughed from the surface of the skin.
          #### 6. Wear loose, preferably cotton clothing over the fresh tattoo.
          Bra straps, tight waistband, sweaty gym shoes or itchy garments can   potentially create healing problems. Consult your tattoo artist for   advice on what clothing to wear/avoid.
          #### 7. After a few days, the tattoo will begin to form flaky scabs   that will fall off on their own.
          DO NOT PICK OR SCRATCH AT YOUR TATTOO. Keep it moisturized and the  scabs will slough eventually. Once again, they will be the color of  the tattoo. It normally takes 2-4 weeks for a tattoo to completely   heal. If you have ANY questions about your healing, please contact  one of our artists at [785-833-5083](tel:785-833-5083). Please do not  consult your friends about healing issues, as everyone’s experience  is unique. Our artists are more than happy to help with any concerns   you might have.

          ### Saniderm Aftercare For Tattoos
          * For maximum comfort, ensure skin is in a neutral position when  applying Saniderm. When applying to elbows and knees, the joint  should be in a neutral position — neither straight nor completely  bent.
          * Shave, shave, shave. Peeling Saniderm off of hair is unpleasant.  Shave the entire area, plus an additional inch all the way around the  site of the tattoo.
          * Practice before you apply. If it's your first time using Saniderm,  it may be a little tricky to work with. It doesn't hurt to practice  with a small section first, just make sure you shave the area.
          * When cutting the bandage for application, remember that rounded   corners provide the best adhesion.
          * It's okay, when using multiple Saniderm bandages, to overlap them   by 1/2 inch (1 cm).
          * If using a glycerin soap, such as green soap, be sure to rinse  thoroughly, as any residue will react with the adhesives and can   cause binding and irritation. Avoid loofahs or scratchy wash cloths.

          * **General:** piercings are a wound. They can cause reactions,   complications, as well as side effects. These include but aren't   limited to skin irritation, loss of consciousness, swelling,   bruising, bleeding (potentially excessively), and infections. We do   everything we can to mitigate these issues, but you as a client   should be aware that we are intentionally puncturing your skin.
          * **Jewelry:** We pierce with implant grade stainless steel or   titanium. **REMOVING YOUR JEWELRY CAN RESULT IN YOUR PIERCING CLOSING.**

          * **Medical Conditions:** If you have a preexisting medical or skin   condition that affects your body's immune system or the body's   healing abilities, you should consult your doctor before getting a   piercing.

          * **Medication:** If you are on any medications that might affect   bleeding(blood thinners) or healing, you should talk to your doctor   about any side effects as well as inform your piercer.
          * **Lifestyle Changes:** Healing a piercing may require changes in   diet, clothing, and sexual activities. All sohuld be considered   beforehand.
