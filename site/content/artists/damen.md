  inspired: Art. I love every style of tattoo and especially surrealism. I strive to be better at everything I’m weak at and I enjoy doing new things. I find I become really inspired when I’m scrolling through Instagram and see some striking Japanese sleeve. I can stare at that kind of thing for hours. 
  specializes: I don't specialize in any one style of tattooing. I really enjoy doing black and gray tattoos, surrealism, Japanese, Japanese traditional, and American Traditional. I’ve been drawing my whole life and I’ve always gravitated towards pencil drawing and smooth black and gray.   
  firstTattoo: The first tattoo I ever performed was on my good friend and at the time, coworker. It was a small drawing of the lead character from the band “Gorillaz”. I learned a lot and slowly got better at what I do over time. 
  outside: I have two kids and a wife who I love very much. They’re my priority, but outside of them I enjoy drawing when I find the time.
