bio: 
  type: Tattooing
  since: 2006
  inspired: I am really lucky to be able to do tattoos for a living. I have loved doing art for as long as I can remember. The opportunity to make art that patrons can wear for the rest of their lives is why I do what I do. 
  specializes: I don't specialize in any one style of tattooing. My mom taught me how to draw as a kid, and since then I have worked on lots of different styles. While I don't speicalize in any particular style my favorite I really enjoy traditional tattoos because of their bold color and design.  
  firstTattoo: One of my favorite tattoos is a panther that I got on my right shoulder by Richard Stell. When I got this tattoo I wasn't even very interested in panthers, but I saw how he did panthers and decided that I wanted one. 
  outside: Outside of tattooing I like drawing and painting when I have time, but my main priority outside of the shop is spending time with my family.
